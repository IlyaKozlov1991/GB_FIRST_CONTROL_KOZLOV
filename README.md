Task: write a program which will create a string array with strings which length is less or equal 3 from initial (received) string array.

Solution:
As the first step it will be neccessary to split strings in initial array to remove separators (" ", "," etc.). Then splitted strings will be saved in new array. This new array will be processed by means of special Function to check length of its elements basing on rule "length <= 3". The Function will also print elements which are under the rule.
